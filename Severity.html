      <h2>Severity</h2>
      <br>
      <p>It’s estimated that 20 percent of people with COVID-19 will need to be hospitalized for treatment.
      <br>
      A smaller percentage of this group will need mechanical ventilation.</p>
      <p>SARS cases were more severe, in general. It’s estimated that 20 to 30 percent of people with SARS required mechanical ventilation.</p>
      <p>Estimates of the mortality rate of COVID-19 vary greatly depending on factors like location and the characteristics of a population.
      <br>
      Generally speaking, mortality rates for COVID-19 have been estimated to range between 0.25 and 3 percent.</p>
      <p>SARS is much more deadly than COVID-19. The estimated mortality rate is about 10 percent.<p/>
    </section>

    <section id="b">
      <h2>Transmission</h2>
      <br>
      <p>COVID-19 appears to transmit more easily than SARS. One possible explanation is that the amount of virus,
      <br>
      or viral load, appears to be highest in the nose and throat of people with COVID-19 shortly after symptoms develop.</p>
      <p>This is in contrast to SARS, in which viral loads peaked much later in the illness. This indicates that people with COVID-19 may be
      <br>
      transmitting the virus earlier in the course of the infection, just as their symptoms are developing, but before they begin to worsen.</p>
      <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), some research
      <br>
      suggests that COVID-19 can be spread by people who aren’t showing symptoms.</p>
      <p>Another difference between the two illnesses is the fact that there haven’t been any reported
      <br>
      cases of SARS transmission before symptom development.</p>

    <section id="c">
      <h2>Molecular factors</h2>
      <br>
      <p>A recent study of the complete genetic information (genome) of SARS-CoV-2 samples
      <br>
      found that the virus was more closely related to bat coronaviruses than the SARS virus.
      <br>
      The new coronavirus has a 79 percent genetic similarity to the SARS virus.</p>
      <p>The receptor binding site of SARS-CoV-2 was also compared to other coronaviruses. Remember that to enter a cell,
      <br>
      a virus needs to interact with proteins on the cell’s surface (receptors). The virus does this via proteins on its own surface.</p>
      <p>When the protein sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding site was analyzed, an interesting result was found.
      <br>
      While SARS-CoV-2 is overall more similar to bat coronaviruses, the receptor binding site was more similar to SARS-CoV.</p>

      <h2>Will COVID-19 be around longer than SARS?</h2>
      <br>
      <p>There have been no global SARS outbreaks since 2003. The last reported cases were
      <br>
      in 2004 and were acquired in a lab. There have been no more cases reported since then.</p>
      <br>
      <h5>SARS has been successfully contained using public health measures, such as:</h5>
      <br>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;· early cas detection and isolation</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;· contact tracting and isolation</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;· social distancing</p>
      <br>
      <h5>Some factors that may contribute to COVID-19 being around for longer include the following:</h5>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;· About 80 percent of people with COVID-19 have a mild illness. Some may not even
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know that they’re sick. This makes it harder to determine who’s infected and who’s not.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;· People with COVID-19 appear to shed the virus earlier in the course of their infection than people with
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SARS. This makes it more difficult to detect who has the virus and isolate them before they spread it to others.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;· COVID-19 is now spreading easily within communities. This was not the case with SARS, which was more commonly spread in healthcare settings.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;· We’re even more globally connected than we were in 2003, making it easier for COVID-19 to spread between regions and countries.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Some viruses, such as the flu and the common cold, follow seasonal patterns. Because of this, there’s
      <br>
      the question as to whether COVID-19 will go away as the weather becomes warmer. It’s unclear if this will happen.</p>
